## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

League of Legends is a free multiplayer online battle arena video game played by millions of people worldwide. As a player myself I hope tshat the analysis of high-elo game data from Korea, data from the best players in the world, can help me understand what in-game factors are the most important, in order to help me improve my own gameplay. I am interested in this data analysis as I have been playing League of Legends for over six years. Over that time, I have improved and ranked up significantly, but have now hit the high-elo barrier. I wish to figure out which objectives are the most important and what early-game events lead to winning in high-elo.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data used in this project is the in-game data from challenger level League of Legends games in Korea. The data was retrieved from Minyong Shin under CC0 and was released April 2020 and includes data for games played during the Spring Spit â€“ Season 10 (January 2020 to April 2020). The data was collected by [Minyong Shin](https://www.kaggle.com/gyejr95) in order to analyze factors that contribute to winning or losing a game, and to use the conclusions from that analysis to predict game wins and losses. The data was collected using a script that collected data via the Riot Developer Portal. Riot is the developer of League of Legends. The exact way the data was sourced can be found [here](https://shinminyong.tistory.com/30). The data includes important in-game factors for both teams at 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and at the end of the game. More information on each of these factors can be found [here](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/new-player-guide#/?_k=cigp47).
